   <img src="w.jpg">
  <p>This webpage was created to showcase the logo I created for Whale Design Studios. </p>
  <p>It includes, but is not limited to, the process of creating the logo, rationale for color choices, appeal to target<br> audience, and design skills.</p>

   <h2 style="background-color:lightgreen">Here are some of my thoughts about creating this logo design:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I created this logo in Adobe Illustrator. I primarily used the pen tool and the direct selection tool to<br>
     modify points. I also used the rectangle shape tool.</li>
    <li>I chose to use an analogous color scheme for this logo. I chose the colors blue, teal, and green. These<br>
        colors remind me of water and fit well with the whale</br>
        icon
<li>I feel this logo appeals to the target audience for several reasons. The name of the business, Whale<br>
 Design Studio, has a quirky sort of feel. The whale icon fits with this quirky kind of vibe, and it has a 
   <br>happy light-hearted sense in its styling. I also feel that the logo has been shaped with the whale icon's<br>
 positioning, giving it a little different form other design logos that I have seen. Overall, it gives the <br>
business identity and personality that one would find if it were looking for design services.</li>
    <li>This logo incorporates the following design skills: tasteful typography, asymmetry, and color theory.<br>
     This logo is an excellent example of using design skills that feature fonts, contrasts with each other. The<br>
     design is asymmetrical, which adds visual interest while still remaining balanced. The colors used work<br>
      well with the whale icon while creating contrast.</li>
